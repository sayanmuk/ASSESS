A very natural consequence of obtaining enrichment scores for each sample in the data set is that classification 
and clustering can now be preformed in the space of gene sets rather than individual genes. In this example, 
ASSESS was applied to an expression data set with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) samples on a database of 377 <a href="example/s2.hugenefl.gmt">gene sets</a>. 
Enrichment scores can be found <a href="example/enrichmentScores.gct">here</a> and shown graphically
<a href="example/heatmap.jpg">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
A matrix factorization method (NMF) was applied to this space of enrichment scores. 
With k=2, clustering obtained from the enrichment space accurately 
differentiated ALL from AML samples.  Clustering with k=3 (see image on right) accurately selected 
three subsets of the samples: ALL-T, ALL-B, and AML all had greater confidence 
than that from the raw expression data.

<h4>Gender Example</h4>
<p>
The enrichment scores from affymetrix gene expression data with probes from 22,283 human genes with gender 
labels was computed in 8 gene sets.  Gene sets were defined by cytogenetic bands and pathway or functional 
properties.  As expected for males chromosome Y as well as its two bands (Yp11 and Yq11) and the gene set 
corresponding to genes enriched in male reproductive tissue (testis) were over expressed.  
For females two gene sets of genes that escape X-inactivation were over expressed in addition 
to a gene set corresponding to genes enriched in female reproductive tissue (uterus).  
The Myc gene set was used as a control in that it is not expected to be enriched with respect 
to the male/female distinction and indeed this is the case. The <a href="example/gender_enrichmentScores.gct">
enrichment scores</a> and heatmap (see picture below) produced by ASSESS are provided here.
